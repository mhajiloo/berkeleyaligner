The Berkeley Word Aligner is a statistical machine translation tool that automatically 
aligns words in a sentence-aligned parallel corpus.

This package draws heavily from the following two papers:

  Percy Liang, Ben Taskar, Dan Klein.  Alignment By Agreement.  NAACL, 2006.
  http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pliang/papers/alignment-naacl2006.pdf

  John DeNero, Dan Klein.  Tailoring Word Alignments to Syntactic Machine Translation.  ACL, 2007.

Overview
========
This manual will soon describe the full range of features supported by the Berkeley Aligner.  
Currently, however, it provides only mininal information on how to align a parallel corpus. 
Check back soon for more. 

Compiling/Installation
======================
If you've downloaded the standard distribution, berkeleyaligner-#.#.tar.gz, then no compilation
or installation should be necessary.  If you've downloaded the source, type "ant".

Package Contents
================
berkeleyaligner.jar - The compiled code repository 
align - A simple shell script to run the aligner
example.conf - An example configuration file
example_syntactic.conf - A second example configuration file for syntactic HMMs
example - A directory of example data from the Hansards corpus

Aligning a Parallel Corpus
==========================
(1)  Prepare the training corpus, matching the format and conventions of the "example/train" 
     directory.  Parallel files designated by common prefixes and contrasting suffixes 
     (e.g., ".e" and ".f") can span multiple directories.  Make sure all files are UTF-8.
     The aligner can take care of lowercasing for you, but tokenization is up to you.
     
(1s) To train a syntactic HMM alignment model, you also need a third parallel file for each
     training set pair that contains phrase structure trees.  The suffix of these files must
     be "{englishSuffix}trees" (e.g., etrees).  We will shortly release a script to create
     such files using the Berkeley Parser.
     
(2)  Create a configuration file, based on example.conf or example_syntactic.conf.
	 Each line in the configuration contains a field name and a value, separated by a tab.
	 The configuration file determines the training regimen, source data, output settings, etc.

(3)  Run the jar, for example using either of the following commands:
	 % ./align example.conf
	 % java -server -mx1000m -jar berkeleyaligner.jar ++example.conf

(3s) To use a syntactic HMM, substitute example_syntactic.conf for example.conf.  You may also
     want to increase the memory (-mxXXXXm) to train on a large corpus.

(4)  Interpreting the output:
	 Everything should be saved to an output directory, which is named by the "execDir" option.
	 In example.conf, the directory is called "output".
	 Following the GIZA++ tradition, there are lots of files here, most of which you won't care
	 about.  The file you typically do want, the aligned training corpus, is called training.e-f.align.
	
With the settings in example.conf, two Model 1s will be trained jointly, one in eachdirection, 
for 2 iterations.  These parameters will be used to train two HMMs jointly for 2 iterations.  

With the settings in example_syntactic.conf, two Model 1s will be trained jointly, one in each
direction, for 2 iterations.  These parameters will be used to train one syntactic and one 
classic HMM independently for 2 iterations.  Despite independent training, these models are 
combined via posterior heuristics at decoding time.

Notes
=====
Make sure all your data files are in UTF-8.
All commands should be run out of the current directory.
If you want to speed things up, turn off "batchTraining" and allocate lots of memory.
